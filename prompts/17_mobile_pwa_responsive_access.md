# Prompt 17 - Mobile, PWA, and Responsive Access Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit mobile usability, responsive layouts, PWA behavior, offline readiness, installability, push, and touch workflows.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/17_mobile_pwa_responsive_access.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `MOB`.

Examples:

- `MOB-P0-001`
- `MOB-P1-001`
- `MOB-P2-001`
- `MOB-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for viewport?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for responsive layouts?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for mobile nav?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for touch targets?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for mobile forms?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for mobile dialogs/tables?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for auth/dashboard/admin mobile?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for pwa manifest?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for service worker?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for offline fallback?

## Scope to analyze

- Viewport
- Responsive layouts
- Mobile nav
- Touch targets
- Mobile forms
- Mobile dialogs/tables
- Auth/dashboard/admin mobile
- PWA manifest
- Service worker
- Offline fallback
- Install prompt
- Push notifications
- Icons
- Cache strategy
- Update flow
- Background sync
- Mobile E2E
- Touch accessibility

## Required special checks

- Detect horizontal overflow and desktop-only layouts
- Review service worker cache risks
- Check notification permission UX

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Mobile workflow inventory
- PWA inventory
- Responsive findings
- Push/offline test plan

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
