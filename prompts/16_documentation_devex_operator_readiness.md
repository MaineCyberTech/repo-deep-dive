# Prompt 16 - Documentation, Developer Experience, and Operator Readiness Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit whether developers, operators, and AI agents can understand, run, test, deploy, and maintain the repo safely.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/16_documentation_devex_operator_readiness.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `DOC`.

Examples:

- `DOC-P0-001`
- `DOC-P1-001`
- `DOC-P2-001`
- `DOC-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for readme?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for local setup?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for env docs?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for architecture/api docs?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for db/migration docs?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for testing docs?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for deploy/rollback docs?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for incident/security docs?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for contribution/coding standards?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for pr/release process?

## Scope to analyze

- README
- Local setup
- Env docs
- Architecture/API docs
- DB/migration docs
- Testing docs
- Deploy/rollback docs
- Incident/security docs
- Contribution/coding standards
- PR/release process
- Operator manuals
- Troubleshooting
- ADRs/diagrams
- Onboarding
- Script docs
- Known limitations
- AI agent instructions
- Prompt packs
- Repo maps

## Required special checks

- Create a recommended documentation set
- Review new-developer journey
- Validate docs against existing scripts/configs

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Identify the single authoritative "current state" source; flag status artifacts that contradict it or hardcode values that should derive from state.
- Walk the quick start and onboarding path literally; record failures and missing steps.
- Inventory dangerous scripts; check runbook placement, warning labels, and blast-radius documentation.
- Scan for broken references, unresolvable paths, and documents presented as current that are historical drafts.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Documentation inventory
- New developer journey
- Operator readiness checklist
- Rewrite suggestions

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
