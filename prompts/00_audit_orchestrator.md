# Prompt 00 - Audit Orchestrator

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Coordinate the full audit run, establish scope, execute order, evidence rules, manifest, and final output map.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/00_audit_orchestrator.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `ORCH`.

Examples:

- `ORCH-P0-001`
- `ORCH-P1-001`
- `ORCH-P2-001`
- `ORCH-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for repository type and monorepo boundaries?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for app/service/package map?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for audit prompts to run and dependencies?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for current branch/sha/run naming?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for report inventory and expected files?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for risk aggregation strategy?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for finding id scheme?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for do-not-touch safety zones?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for final index requirements?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for operator handoff requirements?

## Scope to analyze

- Repository type and monorepo boundaries
- App/service/package map
- Audit prompts to run and dependencies
- Current branch/SHA/run naming
- Report inventory and expected files
- Risk aggregation strategy
- Finding ID scheme
- Do-not-touch safety zones
- Final index requirements
- Operator handoff requirements

## Required special checks

- Confirm all prompt outputs write only under docs/audits/{name}/{run}/
- Create a machine-readable run manifest
- Identify missing evidence that later prompts must gather
- Define aggregation categories for final risk register

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Define the claim sample set for the run (headline statuses, gates, release artifacts) before the fan-out; record an outcome per claim.
- Ensure every report includes a `Verification Performed` section; flag reports that restate claims without reproduction.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- `INDEX.md`
- audit_manifest.json style block
- ordered execution plan
- report output map
- Scaffold the run folder first with `tools/new_run.py --run {run}` (creates the INDEX skeleton and seed manifest); the orchestrator then fills it in Wave 0

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
