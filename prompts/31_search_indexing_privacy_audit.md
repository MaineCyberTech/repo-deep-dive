# Prompt 31 - Search, Indexing, and Privacy Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit search/indexing features for authorization, tenant isolation, sensitive fields, deletion, analytics, and privacy.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/31_search_indexing_privacy_audit.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `SEARCH`.

Examples:

- `SEARCH-P0-001`
- `SEARCH-P1-001`
- `SEARCH-P2-001`
- `SEARCH-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for search routes/ui?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for indexes?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for indexing jobs?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for indexed fields?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for tenant filters?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for permission filters?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for document/ticket/project/message search?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for admin/global search?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for autocomplete?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for search logs?

## Scope to analyze

- Search routes/UI
- Indexes
- Indexing jobs
- Indexed fields
- Tenant filters
- Permission filters
- Document/ticket/project/message search
- Admin/global search
- Autocomplete
- Search logs
- Query analytics
- Deleted data removal
- Reindexing
- External provider
- Tests/docs

## Required special checks

- Search filters must be server-side
- Indexes need tenant scope
- Deleted/private sensitive data must not remain searchable

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- For every index or table: owner, retention policy, and cleanup; list leftovers without one.
- Check mapping and schema drift between old and new data that silently breaks queries (for example, text vs keyword fields).

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Search surface inventory
- Indexed data inventory
- Authorization review
- Privacy tests

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
