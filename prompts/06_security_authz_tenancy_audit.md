# Prompt 06 - Security, Authorization, and Tenancy Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Perform a deep security audit of authn, authz, tenant isolation, input validation, secrets, sessions, APIs, and secure defaults.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/06_security_authz_tenancy_audit.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `SEC`.

Examples:

- `SEC-P0-001`
- `SEC-P1-001`
- `SEC-P2-001`
- `SEC-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for auth provider?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for session tokens/cookies?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for jwt validation?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for csrf/cors?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for rate limits?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for security headers?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for input/output validation?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for file handling?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for api permissions?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for admin permissions?

## Scope to analyze

- Auth provider
- Session tokens/cookies
- JWT validation
- CSRF/CORS
- Rate limits
- Security headers
- Input/output validation
- File handling
- API permissions
- Admin permissions
- Tenant/org/workspace isolation
- RLS policies
- Public/internal routes
- Webhooks
- API keys
- Secrets
- Reset/invite/account lifecycle
- Audit/security logging
- Dependency risk
- IDOR
- SSRF
- Mass assignment
- Sensitive logs

## Required special checks

- Verify server-side authorization independent of UI
- Check all object access is tenant scoped
- Check environment validation
- Check rate limits are keyed beyond IP where accounts exist; per-IP-only limits fall to IP rotation, so auth endpoints need per-account or per-email limits
- Identify P0/P1 release blockers

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Identify every path where lower-trust input (user-supplied certificates, agent-written files, webhook payloads, uploads) is consumed by a higher-privilege component; verify validation and authorization at that boundary.
- Check for privilege escalation via identifier or role strings (names or subjects that map to roles) rather than unforgeable credentials.
- Verify secret material does not appear in release or delivery artifacts (cross-check with prompts 11 and 38).

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Threat model
- Authn/Authz inventory
- Tenant isolation review
- OWASP-style findings
- Security regression checklist

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
