# Prompt 32 - Backup and Restore Drill Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit backup/restore readiness and produce practical disaster recovery drill plan.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/32_backup_restore_drill.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `DR`.

Examples:

- `DR-P0-001`
- `DR-P1-001`
- `DR-P2-001`
- `DR-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for database backups?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for supabase restore docs?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for storage backups?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for uploaded docs/files?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for secrets backup?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for infra config?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for migration rollback?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for export tools?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for seeds?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for restore scripts?

## Scope to analyze

- Database backups
- Supabase restore docs
- Storage backups
- Uploaded docs/files
- Secrets backup
- Infra config
- Migration rollback
- Export tools
- Seeds
- Restore scripts
- DR runbooks
- RPO/RTO
- Validation tests
- Backup access controls
- Encryption
- Local/staging/prod restore guardrails

## Required special checks

- Backups are insufficient unless restore is tested
- Include tenant integrity validation after restore
- Include bad migration drill

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Distinguish configured from exercised: state the last real restore and its evidence, or mark it `not exercised`.
- Check that backup failures alert, and list coverage gaps (datasets not backed up) as fixed or explicitly accepted.
- Check for duplicate jobs, undocumented recoverability windows, and rehearsal scope narrower than the production claim.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- `backup_restore_drill_plan.md`
- Backup inventory
- Restore dependency inventory
- Drill plans
- Verification checklist

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
