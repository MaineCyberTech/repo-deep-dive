# Prompt 08 - API Contracts, Realtime, and Integrations Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit API correctness, contracts, realtime channels, webhooks, external integrations, pagination, errors, retries, and idempotency.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/08_api_contracts_realtime_integrations.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `API`.

Examples:

- `API-P0-001`
- `API-P1-001`
- `API-P2-001`
- `API-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for rest/rpc routes?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for server actions?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for websocket/realtime?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for subscriptions/events?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for webhooks?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for external clients?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for retries/timeouts/circuit breakers?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for pagination/filter/sort?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for error response format?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for openapi/versioning?

## Scope to analyze

- REST/RPC routes
- Server actions
- WebSocket/realtime
- Subscriptions/events
- Webhooks
- External clients
- Retries/timeouts/circuit breakers
- Pagination/filter/sort
- Error response format
- OpenAPI/versioning
- Request/response validation
- Auth/rate limit
- Background delivery
- Dead-letter handling
- Duplicate event behavior
- Integration secrets
- Tests/docs

## Required special checks

- Every route should have validation and auth intent
- Realtime must be authorized
- External calls need timeout/retry/idempotency
- Integration failures must not corrupt local state

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Verify the contract (OpenAPI / GraphQL / schema) against the implementation's route table; enumerate implemented-but-undocumented and documented-but-missing endpoints.
- Check statements in the contract (idempotency, auth, error shapes) against actual handler behavior.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- API inventory
- Realtime inventory
- Integration inventory
- Contract test plan

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
