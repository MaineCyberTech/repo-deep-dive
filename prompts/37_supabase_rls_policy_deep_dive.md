# Prompt 37 - Supabase RLS Policy Deep-Dive Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit Supabase/Postgres RLS policies, grants, storage policies, functions, triggers, service role usage, and app consistency.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/37_supabase_rls_policy_deep_dive.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `RLS`.

Examples:

- `RLS-P0-001`
- `RLS-P1-001`
- `RLS-P2-001`
- `RLS-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for supabase migrations?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for sql schema?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for rls enablement?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for policies?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for grants/roles?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for storage bucket policies?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for functions/triggers?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for security definer?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for generated types?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for app queries?

## Scope to analyze

- Supabase migrations
- SQL schema
- RLS enablement
- Policies
- Grants/roles
- Storage bucket policies
- Functions/triggers
- Security definer
- Generated types
- App queries
- Tenant/user matching
- Admin bypass
- Service role usage
- Client/server Supabase
- RLS tests
- Migration CI
- Docs

## Required special checks

- If not Supabase/Postgres RLS, produce equivalent-control readiness report
- Check WITH CHECK on writes
- Check security definer search_path
- Flag service role misuse

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Table policy inventory
- Storage policy inventory
- Function review
- RLS test plan
- Migration patch suggestions

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
