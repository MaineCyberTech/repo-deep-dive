# Prompt 11 - Supply Chain, Dependency, and Secrets Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit package dependencies, lockfiles, scripts, dependency updates, secret exposure, SBOM, provenance, and license risk.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/11_supply_chain_dependency_secrets.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `SC`.

Examples:

- `SC-P0-001`
- `SC-P1-001`
- `SC-P2-001`
- `SC-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for package manifests?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for lockfiles?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for workspace dependencies?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for unused/duplicate/deprecated deps?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for native/build deps?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for transitive risk indicators?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for dependabot/renovate?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for package scripts/postinstall?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for docker base images?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for github actions deps?

## Scope to analyze

- Package manifests
- Lockfiles
- Workspace dependencies
- Unused/duplicate/deprecated deps
- Native/build deps
- Transitive risk indicators
- Dependabot/Renovate
- Package scripts/postinstall
- Docker base images
- GitHub Actions deps
- Environment examples
- Secret-like strings
- API keys/tokens/certs/SSH
- Service account files
- .env handling
- Secret rotation docs
- SBOM/provenance/signing
- Container scanning
- License risk

## Required special checks

- Do not print secret values
- Identify multiple lockfiles
- Check latest tags/unpinned actions
- Recommend dependency review/license gates

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Check release and delivery artifacts for secret material (keys, credential files, secret backups); verify protection, exclusion rules, and whether secret hashes are published.
- Verify dependency and license policy is enforced in CI, not only documented.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Dependency inventory
- Script inventory
- Secrets exposure review
- SBOM/provenance recommendations

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
