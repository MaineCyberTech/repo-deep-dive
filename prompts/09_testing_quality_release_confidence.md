# Prompt 09 - Testing, Quality, and Release Confidence Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit whether the repo has enough validation to release safely and repeatedly.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/09_testing_quality_release_confidence.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `TEST`.

Examples:

- `TEST-P0-001`
- `TEST-P1-001`
- `TEST-P2-001`
- `TEST-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for unit tests?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for integration tests?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for api tests?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for e2e?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for component tests?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for visual regression?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for accessibility?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for contract tests?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for migration tests?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for security tests?

## Scope to analyze

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- API tests
- E2E
- Component tests
- Visual regression
- Accessibility
- Contract tests
- Migration tests
- Security tests
- Load/failure tests
- Smoke tests
- CI execution
- Flaky risks
- Test data/mocking
- Coverage
- Critical paths
- Pre-commit hooks
- Local commands
- Docs

## Required special checks

- Score each testing category 0-5
- Map critical workflows to coverage
- Identify blocking release gaps
- Recommend CI gate changes

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Distinguish what the validation command runs from what the test suite runs; state explicitly what "all checks pass" does NOT cover.
- Verify quality claims are cited to captures that actually show success (not truncated output, failing runs, or unexplained tracebacks).
- Require boundary and negative tests for destructive helpers and state machines (empty, mixed, expired, concurrent inputs).

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Test inventory
- Critical workflow coverage matrix
- Release confidence scorecard
- Manual QA checklist

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
