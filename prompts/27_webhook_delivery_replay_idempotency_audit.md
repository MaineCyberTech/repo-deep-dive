# Prompt 27 - Webhook Delivery, Replay, and Idempotency Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit inbound/outbound webhooks for auth, signatures, replay protection, idempotency, retries, DLQ, tenant scoping, and observability.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/27_webhook_delivery_replay_idempotency_audit.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `WH`.

Examples:

- `WH-P0-001`
- `WH-P1-001`
- `WH-P2-001`
- `WH-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for inbound endpoints?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for outbound delivery?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for event models?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for signature verification?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for timestamp tolerance?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for replay nonce?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for idempotency keys?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for retry backoff?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for dead-letter queues?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for secrets?

## Scope to analyze

- Inbound endpoints
- Outbound delivery
- Event models
- Signature verification
- Timestamp tolerance
- Replay nonce
- Idempotency keys
- Retry backoff
- Dead-letter queues
- Secrets
- Tenant scoping
- Payload schema/size
- Timeouts
- Delivery logs
- Admin management
- Secret rotation
- Tests/docs

## Required special checks

- Webhooks without signature or timestamp are high risk
- Retries require idempotency
- Failures must be visible to admins/operators
- Verify inbound signatures are computed over the raw request body; frameworks that parse before verifying break signature validation

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Webhook inventory
- Signature/replay/idempotency findings
- Retry/DLQ review
- Webhook tests

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
