# Prompt 36 - Container Runtime Security Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit Dockerfiles, image build hardening, runtime security, secrets, health checks, users, and deployment safety.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/36_container_runtime_security.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `CTR`.

Examples:

- `CTR-P0-001`
- `CTR-P1-001`
- `CTR-P2-001`
- `CTR-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for dockerfiles?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for compose?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for build stages?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for base images/tags?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for package installs?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for non-root users?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for file permissions?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for entrypoints?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for health checks?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for ports?

## Scope to analyze

- Dockerfiles
- Compose
- Build stages
- Base images/tags
- Package installs
- Non-root users
- File permissions
- Entrypoints
- Health checks
- Ports
- Build args
- Runtime env
- Secrets injection
- .dockerignore
- Image size
- Multi-stage builds
- Caching
- Native binaries
- Graceful shutdown
- Stdout logging
- Read-only FS
- Capabilities
- Scanning
- SBOM
- Deploy docs

## Required special checks

- Flag root runtime and latest tags
- Check secrets copied into images
- Check dev deps in prod images
- Recommend runtime security profile

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Compare running container configuration with declared configuration; flag drift.
- Identify privileged components that consume lower-trust input (agent-written files, shared volumes, sockets) and verify validation.
- Check mount and socket privileges and image provenance.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Container inventory
- Build/runtime hardening findings
- Dockerfile improvements
- Validation tests

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
