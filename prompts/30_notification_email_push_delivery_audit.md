# Prompt 30 - Notification, Email, and Push Delivery Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit in-app, email, push, reminders, alerts, preferences, retries, duplicates, and sensitive notification content.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/30_notification_email_push_delivery_audit.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `NOTIF`.

Examples:

- `NOTIF-P0-001`
- `NOTIF-P1-001`
- `NOTIF-P2-001`
- `NOTIF-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for notification models?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for email templates?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for push subscriptions?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for vapid/config?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for reminder jobs?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for preferences?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for tenant scoping?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for unsubscribe/opt-out?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for retries?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for failure handling?

## Scope to analyze

- Notification models
- Email templates
- Push subscriptions
- VAPID/config
- Reminder jobs
- Preferences
- Tenant scoping
- Unsubscribe/opt-out
- Retries
- Failure handling
- Duplicate prevention
- Rate limiting
- Sensitive content
- Permission UX
- Sender config
- Worker queues
- Audit logs
- Tests/docs

## Required special checks

- Check preference/consent before sends
- Avoid sensitive content in previews
- Scheduled sends must be idempotent

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Verify delivery end to end (test send where safe), including failover paths and dead-man notifications.
- Quantify notification noise per rule and channel; flag flapping, duplicates, and missing dedupe.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Notification channel inventory
- Preference review
- Delivery reliability review
- Push/email tests

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
