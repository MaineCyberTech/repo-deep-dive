# Prompt 13 - Resilience, Recovery, and Failure Modes Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit failure behavior under partial outages, retries, crashes, migration failures, and recovery events.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/13_resilience_recovery_failure_modes.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `RES`.

Examples:

- `RES-P0-001`
- `RES-P1-001`
- `RES-P2-001`
- `RES-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for timeouts?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for retries/backoff?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for idempotency?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for circuit breakers?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for queue dlq?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for webhook recovery?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for worker recovery?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for graceful shutdown?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for db/redis/api/email/file/realtime failure?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for offline client?

## Scope to analyze

- Timeouts
- Retries/backoff
- Idempotency
- Circuit breakers
- Queue DLQ
- Webhook recovery
- Worker recovery
- Graceful shutdown
- DB/Redis/API/email/file/realtime failure
- Offline client
- Transactions
- Partial writes
- Duplicate events
- Backups/restore
- Rollback
- Incident runbooks
- Failure injection/load tests

## Required special checks

- Look for infinite retries/no idempotency/no DLQ
- Map critical failure modes
- Recommend chaos/failure tests

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- For each failure mode, identify the detector; if the detector lives inside the failed domain, require an external dead-man's switch.
- Verify recovery procedures were actually exercised (state the last exercise date and evidence) rather than only written.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Failure mode inventory
- Critical path resilience matrix
- Recovery readiness
- Chaos test plan

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
