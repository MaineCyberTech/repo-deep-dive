# Prompt 04 - Usability and Workflow Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit core workflows from the perspective of real users, admins, operators, support staff, and mobile users.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/04_usability_workflow_audit.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `USE`.

Examples:

- `USE-P0-001`
- `USE-P1-001`
- `USE-P2-001`
- `USE-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for onboarding?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for login/signup/reset?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for navigation?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for dashboards?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for forms?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for search/filter/sort?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for bulk workflows?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for admin/support workflows?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for notifications?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for preferences?

## Scope to analyze

- Onboarding
- Login/signup/reset
- Navigation
- Dashboards
- Forms
- Search/filter/sort
- Bulk workflows
- Admin/support workflows
- Notifications
- Preferences
- Error recovery
- Empty/loading states
- Destructive actions
- Session expiry
- Offline/poor network
- Help/support paths

## Required special checks

- Evaluate personas
- Review every critical workflow for clarity, recovery, required fields, and feedback
- Check bulk workflows report per-item results; a single success message over partially failed items is a false success
- Suggest UX copy improvements

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Walk each documented user or operator workflow literally, end to end; record where it fails, dead-ends, or requires tribal knowledge.
- Flag workflows that mutate state unexpectedly and whether their documentation warns before running.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Persona table
- Workflow friction table
- High-friction areas
- UX copy suggestions
- Manual QA scenarios

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
