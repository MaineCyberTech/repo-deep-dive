# Prompt 10 - GitHub Actions, CI/CD, and Governance Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit workflows, PR gates, deployments, release process, environment promotion, permissions, and governance controls.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/10_github_actions_cicd_governance.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `CI`.

Examples:

- `CI-P0-001`
- `CI-P1-001`
- `CI-P2-001`
- `CI-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for .github/workflows?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for pr validation?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for lint/typecheck/test/build?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for deploy workflows?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for migration workflows?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for docker build/push?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for releases?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for badge/report generation?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for secrets?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for permissions blocks?

## Scope to analyze

- .github/workflows
- PR validation
- Lint/typecheck/test/build
- Deploy workflows
- Migration workflows
- Docker build/push
- Releases
- Badge/report generation
- Secrets
- permissions blocks
- OIDC
- Environment protection
- Manual approval
- Concurrency
- Caching
- Artifacts
- PR comments
- Branch protection
- CODEOWNERS
- Dependabot
- Security/SBOM/container scans
- Triggers
- Pinned actions

## Required special checks

- Check pull_request_target danger
- Check broad permissions and unpinned actions
- Check deploy trigger safety
- Recommend required checks

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Enumerate what each required check actually executes; identify drift classes it does not cover (status artifacts vs sources, pins vs delivery, docs vs records).
- Check whether checks can be bypassed (force-push, admin merge, skip flags) and whether bypasses are audited.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Workflow inventory
- CI gate map
- Deployment flow
- Branch protection recommendations
- Workflow patch plan

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
