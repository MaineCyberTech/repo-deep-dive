# Prompt 38 - Environment and Secret Rotation Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit env vars, secrets, key rotation, scope boundaries, startup validation, exposure risk, and emergency revocation.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/38_env_secret_rotation.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `SECRET`.

Examples:

- `SECRET-P0-001`
- `SECRET-P1-001`
- `SECRET-P2-001`
- `SECRET-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for .env.example?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for env docs?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for runtime validators?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for ci/deploy/local secrets?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for api/jwt/db/supabase/webhook/oauth/email/push/sentry/payment/cloud/github keys?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for naming consistency?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for client-exposed vars?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for rotation/revocation docs?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for break-glass?

## Scope to analyze

- .env.example
- Env docs
- Runtime validators
- CI/deploy/local secrets
- API/JWT/DB/Supabase/webhook/OAuth/email/push/Sentry/payment/cloud/GitHub keys
- Naming consistency
- Client-exposed vars
- Rotation/revocation docs
- Break-glass

## Required special checks

- Do not print secret values
- Identify client exposure
- Identify shared cross-environment secrets
- Create rotation runbook

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Check for secret material in release and delivery artifacts and unprotected backups; verify exclusion rules.
- Verify rotation evidence (dates, artifacts, affected credentials), not only rotation policy; check cleartext credential stores and file permissions.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- `secret_rotation_runbook.md`
- Environment variable inventory
- Secret classification
- Emergency revocation plan

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
