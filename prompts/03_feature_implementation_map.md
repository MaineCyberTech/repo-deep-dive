# Prompt 03 - Feature Implementation and Gap Map

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Map all implemented and partial features to UI, API, data, worker, permissions, tests, docs, and missing work.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/03_feature_implementation_map.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `FEAT`.

Examples:

- `FEAT-P0-001`
- `FEAT-P1-001`
- `FEAT-P2-001`
- `FEAT-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for pages/routes?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for components?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for api endpoints?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for server actions?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for workers/jobs?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for database entities?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for permissions?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for audit logs?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for tests?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for docs?

## Scope to analyze

- Pages/routes
- Components
- API endpoints
- Server actions
- Workers/jobs
- Database entities
- Permissions
- Audit logs
- Tests
- Docs
- Workflow states
- Failure states
- Mobile behavior
- Observability hooks

## Required special checks

- Detect UI without backend and backend without UI
- Score completeness 0-5
- Find orphaned routes/modules
- Identify missing tests/docs per feature

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Verify each mapped feature's claimed status (done / partial / absent) against code and records; flag stale claims.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Feature inventory table
- Workflow maps
- Completeness scorecard
- Gap backlog

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
