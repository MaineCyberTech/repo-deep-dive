# Prompt 21 - Repository Hygiene, Maintainability, and Code Health Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit maintainability, naming, duplication, complexity, stale files, config sprawl, typing, linting, and long-term burden.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/21_repo_hygiene_maintainability.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `HYGIENE`.

Examples:

- `HYGIENE-P0-001`
- `HYGIENE-P1-001`
- `HYGIENE-P2-001`
- `HYGIENE-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for folder/file naming?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for duplicate/dead/unused code?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for generated/build artifacts?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for imports and circular deps?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for large files/components?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for type safety/any usage?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for error handling?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for todo/fixme?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for logging consistency?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for config sprawl?

## Scope to analyze

- Folder/file naming
- Duplicate/dead/unused code
- Generated/build artifacts
- Imports and circular deps
- Large files/components
- Type safety/any usage
- Error handling
- TODO/FIXME
- Logging consistency
- Config sprawl
- Competing patterns
- Package scripts
- Dependency boundaries
- Test utilities
- Docs drift
- Changelog/ADRs

## Required special checks

- Score maintainability categories 0-5
- Identify cleanup backlog
- Recommend repo standards

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Identify stale generated artifacts (packs, digests, responses, indexes) and whether regeneration is enforced.
- Flag duplicate or dead files that mislead (obsolete scripts, duplicate docs) and broken reference chains.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Code health summary
- Duplicate/stale findings
- Complexity hotspots
- Maintainability scorecard

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
