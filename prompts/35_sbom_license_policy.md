# Prompt 35 - SBOM and License Policy Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit SBOM readiness, license risk, dependency review, vulnerable dependency handling, and release provenance.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/35_sbom_license_policy.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `SBOM`.

Examples:

- `SBOM-P0-001`
- `SBOM-P1-001`
- `SBOM-P2-001`
- `SBOM-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for package manifests?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for lockfiles?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for docker images?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for github actions?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for dependency updates?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for license fields?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for third-party/transitive deps?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for sbom workflows?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for container sbom?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for dependency review?

## Scope to analyze

- Package manifests
- Lockfiles
- Docker images
- GitHub Actions
- Dependency updates
- License fields
- Third-party/transitive deps
- SBOM workflows
- Container SBOM
- Dependency review
- Vulnerability alerts
- Release provenance
- Signing/attestation
- License policy
- Exception process

## Required special checks

- Recommend allow/deny license policy
- Include CI gates
- Include Docker and GitHub Actions dependencies

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Verify policy enforcement in CI, not only documentation; check SBOM completeness over shipped artifacts.
- Check that artifacts added after signing are excluded or re-signed (no post-signing additions in the release set).

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- `sbom_license_policy_recommendation.md`
- Dependency source inventory
- License risk review
- SBOM workflow

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
