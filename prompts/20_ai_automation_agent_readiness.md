# Prompt 20 - AI Automation and Agent Readiness Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit whether AI coding agents can safely contribute without breaking architecture, security, tests, docs, or release gates.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/20_ai_automation_agent_readiness.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `AI`.

Examples:

- `AI-P0-001`
- `AI-P1-001`
- `AI-P2-001`
- `AI-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for agent instructions?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for copilot/cursor/windsurf/claude configs?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for prompt packs?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for repo maps?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for conventions?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for validation commands?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for safe-change boundaries?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for do-not-touch areas?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for secrets guidance?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for pr guidance?

## Scope to analyze

- Agent instructions
- Copilot/Cursor/Windsurf/Claude configs
- Prompt packs
- Repo maps
- Conventions
- Validation commands
- Safe-change boundaries
- Do-not-touch areas
- Secrets guidance
- PR guidance
- Audit output conventions
- Generated code risks
- CI gates
- Human approvals
- Rollback expectations
- Prompt injection risks
- AI code provenance

## Required special checks

- Warn about untrusted repo content and prompt injection
- Require small-batch PR rules
- Recommend agent instruction file

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Verify agent instruction files reflect current state; flag directions at closed work, stale gates, or missing boundaries.
- Check automation guardrails: what agents may touch, what requires human approval, and whether those limits are enforced rather than documented.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Agent inventory
- Safe contribution rules
- Missing guardrails
- AI validation checklist

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
