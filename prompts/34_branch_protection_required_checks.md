# Prompt 34 - Branch Protection and Required Checks Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Recommend branch protection, required checks, review rules, environment protections, and governance controls.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/34_branch_protection_required_checks.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `BP`.

Examples:

- `BP-P0-001`
- `BP-P1-001`
- `BP-P2-001`
- `BP-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for workflows/jobs?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for pr templates?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for codeowners?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for dependabot?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for release/deploy/migration/security workflows?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for branch/release/hotfix docs?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for environment approvals?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for manual dispatch?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for workflow risks?

## Scope to analyze

- Workflows/jobs
- PR templates
- CODEOWNERS
- Dependabot
- Release/deploy/migration/security workflows
- Branch/release/hotfix docs
- Environment approvals
- Manual dispatch
- Workflow risks

## Required special checks

- Map workflows to required checks
- Include main/develop/release/hotfix rules
- Define break-glass process

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Enumerate what required checks actually execute and whether they can be bypassed; check the bypass audit trail.
- Verify protected-branch rules match the documented process, and that the documented process is executable.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- `branch_protection_recommendation.md`
- Workflow-to-check mapping
- Required status checks
- Implementation checklist

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
