# Prompt 24 - Access Control Matrix Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Create a complete access-control matrix across roles, permissions, routes, APIs, objects, actions, and data scopes.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/24_access_control_matrix_audit.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `ACM`.

Examples:

- `ACM-P0-001`
- `ACM-P1-001`
- `ACM-P2-001`
- `ACM-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for roles?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for permissions?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for org/tenant/workspace membership?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for project/ticket/document/billing/api key/webhook permission?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for admin console?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for public/authenticated/internal routes?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for server actions?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for api endpoints?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for background jobs?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for db helpers?

## Scope to analyze

- Roles
- Permissions
- Org/tenant/workspace membership
- Project/ticket/document/billing/API key/webhook permission
- Admin console
- Public/authenticated/internal routes
- Server actions
- API endpoints
- Background jobs
- DB helpers
- Middleware
- Client-side hiding
- Server enforcement
- Audit logs
- Authz tests

## Required special checks

- Detect UI-only guards
- Detect object IDs accepted without tenant/member validation
- Find inconsistent permission model
- Suggest forbidden-access tests

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Verify the lifecycle for keys, tokens, and certificates: issuance, expiry, pruning of expired items, and revocation evidence.
- Check that role and identity resolution relies on unforgeable attributes, not user-controlled strings.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- `access_control_matrix.md`
- Role inventory
- Permission inventory
- Route access matrix
- Sensitive action matrix

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
