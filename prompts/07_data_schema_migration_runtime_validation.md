# Prompt 07 - Data, Schema, Migration, and Runtime Validation Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit schema design, migrations, constraints, indexes, runtime validators, config validation, and data lifecycle safety.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/07_data_schema_migration_runtime_validation.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `DATA`.

Examples:

- `DATA-P0-001`
- `DATA-P1-001`
- `DATA-P2-001`
- `DATA-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for database schema?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for migrations?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for constraints?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for indexes?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for foreign keys/cascades?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for rls?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for tenant columns?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for soft deletes?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for audit fields?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for retention?

## Scope to analyze

- Database schema
- Migrations
- Constraints
- Indexes
- Foreign keys/cascades
- RLS
- Tenant columns
- Soft deletes
- Audit fields
- Retention
- Seeds/fixtures
- Generated DB types
- ORM/client usage
- Request/response validators
- Env/config validation
- JSON schema
- Migration CI
- Rollback/drift/backup

## Required special checks

- Find app assumptions not enforced by DB
- Detect nullable/enum drift
- Review migration reversibility and lock risk
- Check mutations for optimistic locking or version preconditions; PATCH-style updates without a version/ETag check risk silent overwrites on concurrent edits
- Recommend validation tests

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- For every destructive or retention helper (purge, evict, prune, delete-by-age), test boundary behavior with mixed fresh and expired data; deleting too much is a latent P0-class defect.
- Verify metric and counter lifecycle: values that should decrease or be consumed (pending counts, queue depth, cursors) can actually decrease.
- Check that every store, index, or table has a retention policy and owner; list leftovers without one.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Data model inventory
- Migration inventory
- Runtime validation inventory
- Schema evolution roadmap

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
