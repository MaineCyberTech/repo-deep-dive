# Prompt 05 - UI/UX, Design System, and Accessibility Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit visual consistency, component reuse, responsive layouts, design-system maturity, and accessibility readiness.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/05_ui_ux_accessibility_audit.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `UX`.

Examples:

- `UX-P0-001`
- `UX-P1-001`
- `UX-P2-001`
- `UX-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for design tokens?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for css/tailwind/theme?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for reusable components?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for layouts/nav?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for forms/dialogs/toasts/tables/cards?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for icons/color/typography/spacing?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for focus states?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for keyboard nav?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for aria?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for semantic html?

## Scope to analyze

- Design tokens
- CSS/Tailwind/theme
- Reusable components
- Layouts/nav
- Forms/dialogs/toasts/tables/cards
- Icons/color/typography/spacing
- Focus states
- Keyboard nav
- ARIA
- Semantic HTML
- Responsive breakpoints
- Dark mode
- Skeletons/errors/empty states
- Storybook
- Visual/A11y tests

## Required special checks

- Use WCAG-style checks
- Call out mobile/table/modal issues
- Identify missing component standards
- Recommend regression tests

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Design-system inventory
- Component inventory
- A11y findings
- Responsive findings
- UI regression plan

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
