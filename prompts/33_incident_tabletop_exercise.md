# Prompt 33 - Incident Tabletop Exercise

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Create and evaluate incident response tabletop exercises based on repository architecture, risks, and operations model.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/33_incident_tabletop_exercise.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `IR`.

Examples:

- `IR-P0-001`
- `IR-P1-001`
- `IR-P2-001`
- `IR-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for incident docs?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for monitoring/alerting?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for rollback?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for security docs?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for deployment docs?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for operator docs?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for data breach process?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for backups?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for audit logs?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for observability?

## Scope to analyze

- Incident docs
- Monitoring/alerting
- Rollback
- Security docs
- Deployment docs
- Operator docs
- Data breach process
- Backups
- Audit logs
- Observability
- CI/CD failures
- Admin abuse
- Tenant isolation
- Webhook/payment/notification failures

## Required special checks

- Include roles, severity, containment, communication, postmortem
- Cover at least eight scenarios
- Provide templates

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Include a scenario for total loss of the monitoring and alerting path itself.
- Review recurring incidents and patterns; verify previous fixes stuck.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- `incident_tabletop_scenarios.md`
- Incident readiness inventory
- Scenario catalog
- Communication templates

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.

- What it does:
- How it appears to work:
- Dependencies:
- Current controls:
- Missing controls:
- Risks:
- Recommended improvement:
- Suggested tests:
- Suggested docs:
