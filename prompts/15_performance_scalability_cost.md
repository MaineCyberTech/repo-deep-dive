# Prompt 15 - Performance, Scalability, and Cost Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit performance bottlenecks, scalability risks, cost drivers, frontend/API/DB/worker efficiency, and CI cost.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/15_performance_scalability_cost.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `PERF`.

Examples:

- `PERF-P0-001`
- `PERF-P1-001`
- `PERF-P2-001`
- `PERF-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for bundle size indicators?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for ssr/client hot spots?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for heavy dependencies?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for images/caching?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for pagination?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for n+1 risks?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for indexes/query patterns?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for worker throughput?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for queue concurrency?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for realtime scaling?

## Scope to analyze

- Bundle size indicators
- SSR/client hot spots
- Heavy dependencies
- Images/caching
- Pagination
- N+1 risks
- Indexes/query patterns
- Worker throughput
- Queue concurrency
- Realtime scaling
- Webhook volume
- Rate limiting
- CDN/proxy
- Container resources
- Build/test times
- CI caching
- Storage/log growth
- Third-party API cost

## Required special checks

- Find unbounded queries/lists
- Recommend performance budgets
- Identify cost-risk hotspots

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Project growth trajectories against thresholds; compute the distance to the first signal and to failure for each critical resource.
- Identify what the first signal is for each resource and whether a warning band exists before the emergency threshold.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Performance inventory
- Frontend/API/DB/worker findings
- Cost risks
- Benchmark plan

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
