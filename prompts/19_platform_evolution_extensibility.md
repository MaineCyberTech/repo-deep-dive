# Prompt 19 - Platform Evolution and Extensibility Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit how easily the platform can evolve with new modules, integrations, tenants, AI features, mobile clients, billing plans, and operations tooling.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/19_platform_evolution_extensibility.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `EVOL`.

Examples:

- `EVOL-P0-001`
- `EVOL-P1-001`
- `EVOL-P2-001`
- `EVOL-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for module boundaries?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for domain model?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for shared packages?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for extension points?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for feature flags?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for permission extensibility?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for tenant/org model?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for api versioning?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for migration strategy?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for eventing/webhooks?

## Scope to analyze

- Module boundaries
- Domain model
- Shared packages
- Extension points
- Feature flags
- Permission extensibility
- Tenant/org model
- API versioning
- Migration strategy
- Eventing/webhooks
- Integration framework
- UI reuse
- Admin tooling
- Background jobs
- Config model
- Observability extensibility
- Docs for adding modules
- AI agent compatibility
- Package extraction

## Required special checks

- Find hardcoded roles/plans/statuses
- Identify extension points and missing abstractions
- Recommend module template

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Evolution readiness summary
- Extension point inventory
- Refactor roadmap
- ADR recommendations

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
