# Prompt 18 - Privacy, Compliance, and Data Governance Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit privacy, data governance, auditability, retention, consent, export/deletion, and compliance readiness.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/18_privacy_compliance_data_governance.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `PRIV`.

Examples:

- `PRIV-P0-001`
- `PRIV-P1-001`
- `PRIV-P2-001`
- `PRIV-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for personal/sensitive data?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for auth records?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for audit logs?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for admin actions?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for billing/payment refs?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for uploaded docs?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for user content?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for export/deletion?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for retention?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for consent/cookie flows?

## Scope to analyze

- Personal/sensitive data
- Auth records
- Audit logs
- Admin actions
- Billing/payment refs
- Uploaded docs
- User content
- Export/deletion
- Retention
- Consent/cookie flows
- Policies/terms
- Access controls
- Encryption assumptions
- Backups
- Incident response
- Vendor data inventory
- Data processing integrations

## Required special checks

- Use SOC2/ISO27001/NIST/CIS/OWASP/CCPA/GDPR/HIPAA/PCI/CMMC as readiness lenses only
- Do not claim formal compliance
- Identify policy/docs needed

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Verify redaction claims against published artifacts (no secret-like values; no personal data beyond policy).
- Check that every dataset has retention and deletion policies and that aggregates state exclusions explicitly.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Data classification inventory
- Control readiness matrix
- Privacy workflow review
- Governance recommendations

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
