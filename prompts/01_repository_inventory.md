# Prompt 01 - Comprehensive Repository Inventory

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Create a narrated inventory explaining what each meaningful folder/file is, how it works, why it matters, and what risks it creates.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/01_repository_inventory.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `INV`.

Examples:

- `INV-P0-001`
- `INV-P1-001`
- `INV-P2-001`
- `INV-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for root configs?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for package/workspace files?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for applications?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for api services?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for workers?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for shared packages?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for database/migrations?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for github metadata?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for tests?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for docs?

## Scope to analyze

- Root configs
- Package/workspace files
- Applications
- API services
- Workers
- Shared packages
- Database/migrations
- GitHub metadata
- Tests
- Docs
- Assets/public files
- Generated artifacts
- Docker/deploy/infra files
- Environment examples

## Required special checks

- Do not skip build, deploy, typing, env, docs, security, or CI files
- Separate source from generated artifacts
- Call out questionable committed artifacts
- Identify likely owners and runtime/build impact

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Inventory generated artifacts (packs, digests, manifests, indexes, status files) and record their regeneration commands and staleness.
- Record repository state (branch, HEAD, dirty state) and any parallel activity for the run manifest.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Inventory summary table
- Sensitive inventory table
- Generated/stale artifact table
- Unknowns table

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
