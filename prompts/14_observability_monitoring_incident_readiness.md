# Prompt 14 - Observability, Monitoring, and Incident Readiness Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit whether operators can detect, triage, debug, and recover from production issues.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/14_observability_monitoring_incident_readiness.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `OBS`.

Examples:

- `OBS-P0-001`
- `OBS-P1-001`
- `OBS-P2-001`
- `OBS-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for structured logs?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for request ids/correlation?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for error tracking?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for metrics?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for tracing?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for health/readiness?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for client/api/worker errors?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for job metrics?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for db/queue/webhook/notification metrics?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for uptime checks?

## Scope to analyze

- Structured logs
- Request IDs/correlation
- Error tracking
- Metrics
- Tracing
- Health/readiness
- Client/API/worker errors
- Job metrics
- DB/queue/webhook/notification metrics
- Uptime checks
- Alerts
- Dashboards
- Incident runbooks
- Audit/security logs
- Release markers
- User-impact signals
- Data-quality signals

## Required special checks

- Evaluate golden signals
- Identify missing alerting/dashboards
- Recommend incident checklist and alerts

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Quantify alert signal quality over a representative window: counts by rule, flapping, and the share of noise.
- For each critical path, prove the alert fires (test where safe) and that delivery works end to end, including failover paths.
- Require monitoring-of-the-monitoring: freshness metrics for exporters and probes, plus an external check that the alerting path itself is alive.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Observability inventory
- Logging/metrics/tracing review
- Golden signals
- Suggested alerts
- Incident checklist

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
