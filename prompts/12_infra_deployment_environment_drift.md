# Prompt 12 - Infrastructure, Deployment, and Environment Drift Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit infrastructure/deploy config, Docker/container setup, env vars, runtime config, hosting assumptions, and drift risks.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/12_infra_deployment_environment_drift.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `INFRA`.

Examples:

- `INFRA-P0-001`
- `INFRA-P1-001`
- `INFRA-P2-001`
- `INFRA-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for dockerfiles?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for compose?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for terraform/opentofu?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for cloud/hosting config?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for deploy scripts?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for reverse proxy?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for environment examples?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for runtime validators?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for secret references?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for build args?

## Scope to analyze

- Dockerfiles
- Compose
- Terraform/OpenTofu
- Cloud/hosting config
- Deploy scripts
- Reverse proxy
- Environment examples
- Runtime validators
- Secret references
- Build args
- Container users
- Health/readiness/liveness
- Logging
- Volumes/networks
- Database/queue/storage settings
- Feature flags
- Rollback
- Blue/green/canary
- Backup hooks

## Required special checks

- Detect client-exposed secrets
- Find env name drift
- Check container root/healthchecks
- Check migrations coupled unsafely to deploy

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Cross-check documented ports, paths, users, and couplings against live configuration where authorized; mark unverifiable rows.
- Identify services whose source of truth lives outside the repository; name their backup coverage and runbook.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Environment inventory
- Runtime config inventory
- Deployment inventory
- Environment matrix
- Hardening checklist

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
