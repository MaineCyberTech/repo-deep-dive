# Prompt 39 - Analytics, Tracking, and Privacy Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit analytics, telemetry, tracking scripts, event capture, cookies, consent, PII handling, and data minimization.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/39_analytics_tracking_privacy.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `AN`.

Examples:

- `AN-P0-001`
- `AN-P1-001`
- `AN-P2-001`
- `AN-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for analytics scripts?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for tracking pixels?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for events?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for product analytics?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for error telemetry?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for session replay?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for cookie banner?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for consent?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for opt-in/out?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for user/tenant ids?

## Scope to analyze

- Analytics scripts
- Tracking pixels
- Events
- Product analytics
- Error telemetry
- Session replay
- Cookie banner
- Consent
- Opt-in/out
- User/tenant IDs
- Sensitive payloads
- Page views
- Admin tracking
- Marketing lead tracking
- Policies
- Retention
- Vendor list
- Do-not-track
- Tests/docs

## Required special checks

- If absent, produce future readiness report
- Third-party scripts should honor consent
- Avoid PII/sensitive event payloads

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Analytics inventory
- Event payload review
- Consent review
- Governance policy
- Tests

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
