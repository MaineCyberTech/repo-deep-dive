# Prompt 25 - Multi-Tenant Isolation Attack Simulation

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Simulate safe code-level abuse cases for cross-tenant data access through IDs, routes, APIs, realtime, files, jobs, cache, and search.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/25_multi_tenant_isolation_attack_simulation.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `MT`.

Examples:

- `MT-P0-001`
- `MT-P1-001`
- `MT-P2-001`
- `MT-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for tenant/org/workspace ids?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for membership checks?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for db queries?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for api routes?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for server actions?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for client fetchers?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for rls?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for storage/file access?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for realtime channels?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for search/export?

## Scope to analyze

- Tenant/org/workspace IDs
- Membership checks
- DB queries
- API routes
- Server actions
- Client fetchers
- RLS
- Storage/file access
- Realtime channels
- Search/export
- Admin overrides
- Invitations
- Notifications
- Background jobs
- Webhooks
- Audit logs
- Caching

## Required special checks

- No destructive actions or data exfiltration
- Focus on repository evidence
- Create attack scenarios MT-001..MT-008
- Require regression tests

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Attack surface inventory
- Scenario results
- Tenant isolation checklist
- Required fixes/tests

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
