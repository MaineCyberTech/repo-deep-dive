# Prompt 22 - Final Risk Register, Roadmap, and Patch Plan

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Aggregate all reports into one risk register, roadmap, patch plan, validation plan, and definition of done.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/22_final_risk_register_roadmap.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `FINAL`.

Examples:

- `FINAL-P0-001`
- `FINAL-P1-001`
- `FINAL-P2-001`
- `FINAL-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for all previous reports?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for p0/p1 risks?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for duplicate findings?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for cross-cutting themes?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for quick wins?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for 7/30/60/90-day plans?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for patch sets?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for validation commands?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for owners/effort/dependencies?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for accepted/deferred risks?

## Scope to analyze

- All previous reports
- P0/P1 risks
- Duplicate findings
- Cross-cutting themes
- Quick wins
- 7/30/60/90-day plans
- Patch sets
- Validation commands
- Owners/effort/dependencies
- Accepted/deferred risks

## Required special checks

- Prioritize P0 then P1 release blockers
- Merge duplicates rather than inflate counts
- Create actionable patch sets
- Group patch sets so every finding lands in exactly one set; the P0-only immediate set carries no dependencies
- Give a fix spanning 3+ files its own patch set even when small; note dependencies when one set must land before another
- Resolve contradictory recommendations into one plan rather than carrying both

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Verify each existing risk's status against the record (closed-but-open, open-but-closed) and flag stale rows.
- Ensure aggregates include N/A and excluded counts explicitly, and reconcile counts with their sources.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- `risk_register.md`
- `roadmap.md`
- `patch_plan.md`
- Patch-set mapping table (ID `PS-00N` → findings → files → dependencies → effort → verification command)
- Consolidated risk table
- Definition of done

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.

### This Week

### This Month

### Later / Platform Evolution

## Quick Wins

| Quick win | Why it helps | Files likely involved | Validation |

## Hardening Backlog

| Backlog item | Priority | Owner suggestion | Effort | Dependency |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Suggested Tests

Include unit, integration, E2E, CI, security, regression, and manual validation ideas as applicable.

## Quality bar

The final report should be detailed enough that an implementation agent can open the report and start creating safe, scoped remediation PRs without needing another discovery pass.
