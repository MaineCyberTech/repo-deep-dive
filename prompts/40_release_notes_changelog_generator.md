# Prompt 40 - Release Notes and Changelog Generator

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Generate release notes and changelog drafts from git history, diffs, audit evidence, migrations, docs, and changed files.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/40_release_notes_changelog_generator.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `REL`.

Examples:

- `REL-P0-001`
- `REL-P1-001`
- `REL-P2-001`
- `REL-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for git history?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for pr templates?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for changelog/release notes templates?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for version files?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for package versions?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for migrations?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for api/ui/security/bug/dependency/infra/docs changes?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for breaking changes?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for known issues?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for operator actions?

## Scope to analyze

- Git history
- PR templates
- Changelog/release notes templates
- Version files
- Package versions
- Migrations
- API/UI/security/bug/dependency/infra/docs changes
- Breaking changes
- Known issues
- Operator actions
- Migration steps
- Rollback notes
- Test evidence
- Audit outputs

## Required special checks

- Do not invent changes
- If git history unavailable, state limitation and use diffs/audit evidence only
- Separate user/admin/operator/security notes

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Verify generated artifacts record the commit and version they were generated from, and match their shipped artifact set.
- Check release filenames are versioned (no overwrite-in-place) and that digests resolve to present artifacts.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- `release_notes_draft.md`
- `changelog_draft.md`
- GitHub release body
- Upgrade/rollback notes

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
