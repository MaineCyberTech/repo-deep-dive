# Prompt 02 - Architecture and Runtime Topology Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Explain system architecture, runtime components, data flow, trust boundaries, deployment topology, and operational model.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/02_architecture_runtime_topology.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `ARCH`.

Examples:

- `ARCH-P0-001`
- `ARCH-P1-001`
- `ARCH-P2-001`
- `ARCH-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for monorepo structure?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for frontend/backend/worker boundaries?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for auth/session flow?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for authorization and tenant boundaries?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for request lifecycle?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for data flow?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for background jobs?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for queues?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for webhooks?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for realtime?

## Scope to analyze

- Monorepo structure
- Frontend/backend/worker boundaries
- Auth/session flow
- Authorization and tenant boundaries
- Request lifecycle
- Data flow
- Background jobs
- Queues
- Webhooks
- Realtime
- Notifications
- External integrations
- Deployment topology
- Environment parity
- Error handling
- Runtime validation

## Required special checks

- Include Mermaid diagrams
- Call out coupling and hidden runtime assumptions
- Identify single points of failure
- Map service-to-service dependencies

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Compare the documented topology (services, ports, paths, couplings) against the live system where read-only access is authorized; otherwise mark live-dependent rows `unverified`.
- List undocumented couplings (shared ports, files, credentials, containers, networks) and name the owner of each.
- Verify diagrams and as-built documents match deployment reality (compose files vs running units vs docs).

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- System context diagram
- Container diagram
- Request sequence
- Auth sequence
- Data flow diagram
- Worker/job flow
- Deployment topology
- Tenant boundary map

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
