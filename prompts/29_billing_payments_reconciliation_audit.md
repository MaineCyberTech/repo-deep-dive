# Prompt 29 - Billing, Payments, and Reconciliation Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit billing/subscription/payment references, plan state, entitlements, webhooks, reconciliation, and sensitive payment data handling.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/29_billing_payments_reconciliation_audit.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `BILL`.

Examples:

- `BILL-P0-001`
- `BILL-P1-001`
- `BILL-P2-001`
- `BILL-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for billing pages?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for subscription/plan models?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for entitlement checks?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for billing apis?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for payment provider integration?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for webhooks?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for invoices/status records?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for reconciliation jobs?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for failed payments?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for refund/cancel/trial states?

## Scope to analyze

- Billing pages
- Subscription/plan models
- Entitlement checks
- Billing APIs
- Payment provider integration
- Webhooks
- Invoices/status records
- Reconciliation jobs
- Failed payments
- Refund/cancel/trial states
- Seat counts
- Usage billing
- Admin/customer UI
- Sensitive data
- Audit logs
- Tests/docs

## Required special checks

- If absent, produce future readiness report
- Gate entitlements server-side
- Webhook events must be idempotent and reconciled

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Billing feature inventory
- Subscription state review
- Entitlement review
- Reconciliation tests

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
