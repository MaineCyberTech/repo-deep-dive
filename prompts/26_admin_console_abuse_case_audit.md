# Prompt 26 - Admin Console Abuse Case Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit admin/operator surfaces for misuse, accidental damage, privilege escalation, unsafe bulk actions, and weak audit logging.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/26_admin_console_abuse_case_audit.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `ADMIN`.

Examples:

- `ADMIN-P0-001`
- `ADMIN-P1-001`
- `ADMIN-P2-001`
- `ADMIN-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for admin pages/apis?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for user/org/role management?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for billing panels?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for document/ticket admin?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for webhook/api key admin?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for bulk ops?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for approval flows?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for impersonation?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for settings?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for exports?

## Scope to analyze

- Admin pages/APIs
- User/org/role management
- Billing panels
- Document/ticket admin
- Webhook/API key admin
- Bulk ops
- Approval flows
- Impersonation
- Settings
- Exports
- Destructive actions
- Confirmations
- Permissions
- Rate limits
- Undo/recovery
- Tests

## Required special checks

- Find self-privilege escalation
- Flag bulk operations without preview
- Check audit logs for role/delete/export actions

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- Admin surface inventory
- Abuse case matrix
- Destructive action review
- Guardrail recommendations

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
