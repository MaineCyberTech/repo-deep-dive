# Prompt 23 - Executive Summary and Release Gate

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Create a leadership-friendly summary and practical release gate decision based on evidence.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/23_executive_summary_release_gate.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `EXEC`.

Examples:

- `EXEC-P0-001`
- `EXEC-P1-001`
- `EXEC-P2-001`
- `EXEC-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for current state?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for strengths?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for biggest risks?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for release blockers?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for business/security/ops/ux impact?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for investment recommendation?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for next actions?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for risk counts/themes?

## Scope to analyze

- Current state
- Strengths
- Biggest risks
- Release blockers
- Business/security/ops/UX impact
- Investment recommendation
- Next actions
- Risk counts/themes

## Required special checks

- NO-GO if unresolved P0
- GO WITH CONDITIONS if P1 mitigated
- GO only with no P0/P1 blockers and validation evidence

## Extended verification checks (base edition v1.1.0)

- Verify gate-supporting artifacts: each review, approval, or sign-off row must cite an artifact produced by the claimant, not a transcription.
- Reconcile the executive summary against machine-readable artifacts; state deltas rather than restating claims.
- If the repository has an existing published verdict or gate, reconcile with it; never grant or revoke it.

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
- `RELEASE_GATE.md`
- Risk summary table
- Next actions

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.

| EXEC-007 | Next actions | Evidence | Current control | Gap | Severity | Recommendation |
| EXEC-008 | Risk counts/themes | Evidence | Current control | Gap | Severity | Recommendation |

## Findings

Use the shared finding format exactly.

## Risks

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Impact | Evidence | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Recommendations

Group recommendations into:

### Immediate / Release Blocking

### This Week

### This Month

### Later / Platform Evolution

## Quick Wins

| Quick win | Why it helps | Files likely involved | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|

## Hardening Backlog

| Backlog item | Priority | Owner suggestion | Effort | Dependency |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Suggested Tests

Include unit, integration, E2E, CI, security, regression, and manual validation ideas as applicable.

## Suggested Documentation Updates

List exact docs to create or update.

## Open Questions

| Question | Why it matters | Evidence needed |
|---|---|---|

## Appendix

Include raw inventories, diagrams, Mermaid diagrams, command outputs, or additional notes as needed.
```

## Quality bar

The final report should be detailed enough that an implementation agent can open the report and start creating safe, scoped remediation PRs without needing another discovery pass.
