# Prompt 28 - File Upload and Download Security Audit

@include `00_SHARED_AUDIT_RULES.md`

## Mission

Audit upload, download, preview, export, attachment, signed URL, storage, and file-sharing flows.

This prompt is part of the **Repo Deep-Dive Full Hardening Edition**. It should produce a repository-specific markdown report with evidence-backed findings, practical fixes, tests, documentation updates, and implementation-ready backlog items.

## Output path

Save the final report to:

`docs/audits/{name}/{run}/28_file_upload_download_security_audit.md`

## Area code

Use finding IDs beginning with `FILE`.

Examples:

- `FILE-P0-001`
- `FILE-P1-001`
- `FILE-P2-001`
- `FILE-P3-001`

## Primary audit questions

1. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for upload components?
2. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for download endpoints?
3. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for document routes?
4. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for attachments?
5. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for storage buckets?
6. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for public/private files?
7. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for signed urls?
8. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for metadata?
9. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for mime/extension/size validation?
10. What repository evidence proves the current behavior for content scanning hooks?

## Scope to analyze

- Upload components
- Download endpoints
- Document routes
- Attachments
- Storage buckets
- Public/private files
- Signed URLs
- Metadata
- MIME/extension/size validation
- Content scanning hooks
- Image/PDF/document previews
- Exports
- Tenant scoping
- Revocation
- Deletion/versioning
- Audit logs
- Retention
- CDN/cache
- Tests

## Required special checks

- Flag public buckets for private data
- Check signed URL lifetime
- Check SVG/script/PDF risks
- Require cross-tenant file tests

## Required outputs and companion artifacts

- File surface inventory
- Upload validation review
- Signed URL review
- Export security review
- Required tests

## Step-by-step execution instructions

1. Read the repository tree and identify all files relevant to this domain.
2. Review source files, configuration files, tests, docs, and generated artifacts separately.
3. Create an evidence inventory before writing findings.
4. For each item in scope, determine whether it is implemented, partially implemented, absent, stale, duplicated, unsafe, undocumented, or unknown.
5. Identify strengths before risks so the report is balanced and useful.
6. Create findings only when there is concrete evidence.
7. Assign severity using the shared P0/P1/P2/P3 model.
8. Suggest exact file-level remediation where possible.
9. Suggest tests that would prove the remediation works.
10. Suggest documentation updates needed to keep operators and future AI agents aligned.
11. End with open questions and evidence gaps.
