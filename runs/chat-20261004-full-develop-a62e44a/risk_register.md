| FINAL-P1-001 | P1 | Release gate must remain conditional pending P2 remediation | @eng-lead | FINAL | open | Derivative gate statement; see RELEASE_GATE.md. |
| OBS-P1-001 | P1 | No alerting wired despite metrics and a tracked TODO (fixed) | @ops | OBS | verified-fixed | PR #95; rules + ntfy receiver rendered by compose. |
| RLS-P1-001 | P1 | Global `users_select USING (true)` policy (fixed) | @db | RLS | verified-fixed | Current canonical policy is scoped; deploy no longer weakens it. |

| SEC-P1-003 | P1 | Admin user directory / audit logs / compliance exports were not tenant-scoped (fixed) | @security | SEC | verified-fixed | SEC-P1-003..006 closed; handlers now derive `getAdminWorkspaceIds(req)`. |
| SEC-P1-004 | P1 | SSH was open to the internet by default (fixed) | @infra | SEC | verified-fixed | `ssh_allowed_ips` is now required and 0.0.0.0/0 is rejected by validation. |

| BP-P2-001 | P2 | In-repo branch-protection gate covers only `main`, not `develop` | @ci | BP | open | Draft remediation chat#108 extends the in-repo gate to the default branch; server-side ruleset still owner-gated (live state: no rules). |
| CHAIN-P2-001 | P2 | Webhook SSRF + missing encryption key form a plausible internal-reach chain | @security | CHAIN | open | Composite of SEC/WH findings; no P0/P1 chain found. |
| CI-P2-001 | P2 | `infra-development` destroys infra on every push to `develop` | @ci | CI | open | Draft remediation chat#107 (manual/plan-only + development environment; unmerged). |
| CI-P2-002 | P2 | Auto-commit workflows hold `contents: write` and push to main/develop | @ci | CI | open | Reaffirms pilot CI-P2-003; both workflows still request contents:write. |
| CI-P2-003 | P2 | `develop` (auto-deploy target) is not covered by the branch-protection gate | @ci | CI | open | Draft remediation chat#108 extends the in-repo gate to the default branch; server-side ruleset still owner-gated (live state: no rules). |
| CI-P2-004 | P2 | `workflow_dispatch` inputs interpolated into `run:` (script injection) (fixed) | @ci | CI | verified-fixed | Closed with the actionlint/CI hardening wave (#97). |
| DATA-P2-001 | P2 | Duplicate `add_user_groups` migrations | @db | DATA | open | Reconciled 2026-10-05: the two migrations are intentional and documented in supabase/migrations/README.md, which explicitly forbids merging/editing/deleting applied migrations. The squash/drop recommendation conflicts with that documented owner decision; needs a DB-owner call (rename vs keep). |
| DATA-P2-002 | P2 | `gdpr_delete_user` is a hard multi-table delete with partial coverage | @db | DATA | open | Reaffirms original DATA-P2-005; not re-verified line-by-line (partial). |

| FILE-P2-001 | P2 | Uploads return a public URL from `chat-uploads` and trust client-declared content type | @api | FILE | open | New at a62e44a; no server-side magic-byte sniff and bucket visibility is unverified server-side. |
| FINAL-P2-001 | P2 | Dependency risk-acceptances expire 2027-01-04 | @security | FINAL | open | Derivative of SC finding. |
| INFRA-P2-001 | P2 | Single-droplet infrastructure has no environment isolation | @infra | INFRA | open | One droplet serves dev and (through the same module) prod flows. |
| INV-P2-001 | P2 | Stale generated reconciliation artifacts remain tracked at the repository root | @maintainer | INV | open | Draft remediation chat#106 (remove stale root artifacts; unmerged). |
| MT-P2-001 | P2 | IDOR: admin dead-letter retry was not tenant-scoped (fixed) | @api | MT | verified-fixed | PR #90; re-verified tenant scoping in the admin webhooks routes. |
| MT-P2-002 | P2 | Cross-tenant user directory via auth service (fixed) | @security | MT | verified-fixed | PR #91; directory now uses an RLS-aware caller client. |
| NOTIF-P2-001 | P2 | Notifications are delivered only via Web Push; no durable multi-channel delivery/retry | @api | NOTIF | open | No email/SMS provider integration; push failures are not retried durably. |
| OBS-P2-001 | P2 | No distributed tracing / correlation to a collector | @ops | OBS | open | OBS-P2-004 residual; request-id/trace-context exist but no OTLP exporter. |
| PRIV-P2-001 | P2 | GDPR erasure path is a hard multi-table delete with partial coverage | @privacy | PRIV | open | Cross-ref DATA finding; the same defect is the privacy owner's concern. |
| RES-P2-001 | P2 | Single-node failure domains: API, worker, Redis and DB proxy co-resident | @infra | RES | open | Ambient/failure-domain analysis; overlaps ARCH/INFRA findings. |
| RLS-P2-001 | P2 | RLS policy test exists but is not executed by CI | @qa | RLS | verified-fixed | Reconciled 2026-10-05: false positive. validate.yml migration-test runs every supabase/tests/*.sql (incl. rls_tenant_isolation.sql) inside the local Supabase Postgres via `docker exec ... psql` at a62e44a; the RLS test is executed by CI. |
| SC-P2-001 | P2 | Production web container received the Supabase service-role key (fixed) | @supply | SC | verified-fixed | PR #92; web compose service no longer receives the service-role key. |

| TEST-P2-002 | P2 | RLS tenant-isolation SQL test exists but is not run by CI | @qa | TEST | verified-fixed | Reconciled 2026-10-05: false positive. validate.yml migration-test runs every supabase/tests/*.sql (incl. rls_tenant_isolation.sql) inside the local Supabase Postgres via `docker exec ... psql` at a62e44a; the RLS test is executed by CI. |
| TEST-P2-003 | P2 | Migration rollback was validated by file existence only (fixed) | @qa | TEST | verified-fixed | Downs are executed in reverse. |
| WH-P2-001 | P2 | Replay/idempotency key was regenerated per attempt (fixed) | @api | WH | verified-fixed | Key created once and reused on retry. |

| CHAIN-P3-001 | P3 | Public upload URL + client-declared content type is a stored-content risk | @security | CHAIN | open | Composite of FILE finding. |
| CI-P3-001 | P3 | 13 workflows omit an explicit `permissions:` block | @ci | CI | open | Reaffirms pilot CI-P3-002; measured at a62e44a. |
