# Release Gate

- Target: `mainecybertech` @ `9c0b88c` (`main`)
- Run: `mainecybertech-20261004-full-main-9c0b88c`
- Decision: **NO-GO**

## Basis

- P0 x6, P1 x59, P2 x166, P3 x105.

> **Reconciliation / fail-closed note.** All six P0 rows below are `verified-fixed` at
> `9c0b88c`; this gate counts register severity regardless of status and mirrors the
> repository's pre-go-live `docs/RELEASE_GATE.md`. Domain rows imported from the
> `20261002-0344` run are carried unverified at this commit (marked in their notes) and are
> treated as open. The only open P1 in the authoritative ledger is `CI-P1-001` (operator
> provisioning). See `verification_log.md`.

## Blocking findings

| ID | Sev | Title |
|---|---|---|
| DATA-P0-001 | P0 | Orphan cleanup can recursively delete a bucket’s contents |
| DR-P0-001 | P0 | Scheduled backup and restore-test workflows never run because they are absent from the default branch |
| DR-P0-002 | P0 | The restore test never asserts integrity and therefore cannot fail on a bad backup |
| IR-P0-001 | P0 | No platform-level incident response plan, roles, or postmortem process |
| IR-P0-002 | P0 | No data breach response / notification process |
| IR-P0-003 | P0 | Total loss of the monitoring/alerting path has no independent dead-man's-switch receiver |
| ACM-P1-001 | P1 | Client-onboarding mutations run without any `requirePermission` gate |
| ADMIN-P1-001 | P1 | Org-agnostic `requireAdmin` lets a tenant admin read other tenants' admin data |
| ADMIN-P1-002 | P1 | Impersonation/cross-tenant access is logged but not reviewable or alerted |
| AI-P1-001 | P1 | Vendored audit prompt packs are stale and the run manifest references a prompt the pack does not contain |
| AI-P1-002 | P1 | `AGENTS.md` names a stale repository path and three developer docs state a stale accessibility gate size that no guard covers |
| BILL-P1-001 | P1 | Module entitlements are derived but not enforced server-side |
| BILL-P1-002 | P1 | `payments` table is never populated; payment history is silently empty |
| BILL-P1-003 | P1 | Missing Stripe webhook events leave refunds, void, and payment lifecycle unrecorded |
| BP-P1-001 | P1 | `main` requires a context (`Dependency Review`) that no job emits |
| BP-P1-002 | P1 | `enforce_admins:false` lets administrators bypass all required checks and reviews |
| BP-P1-003 | P1 | Production deploy path uses the unguarded `prod` environment, not `prod-approval` |
| CHAIN-P1-001 | P1 | Low-trust MSP role key composes into a cross-tenant read pivot |
| CHAIN-P1-002 | P1 | Caller-controlled reset redirect composes into an account-takeover assist |
| CHAIN-P1-008 | P1 | Branch-protection bypass + missing prod gate compose into unattended production change |
| CI-P1-001 | P1 | Production application deploys have no working manual-approval gate |
| CI-P1-002 | P1 | Branch-protection-as-code has a likely-mismatched required check and permits admin bypass |
| CI-P1-003 | P1 | Production deploy path cannot run; prod environment lacks secrets and protection rules |
| CTR-P1-001 | P1 | No Container Image Vulnerability Scan in CI |
| CTR-P1-002 | P1 | SBOM Is Lockfile-Only, Not an Image SBOM or Attestation |
| CTR-P1-003 | P1 | Unsigned Images With No Provenance/Attestation |
| DATA-P1-001 | P1 | Approved-membership RLS predicate reintroduced six times; pending/suspended members could access tenant data |
| DATA-P1-002 | P1 | `retention` worker task performs unbounded deletes and reports success on partial failure |
| DATA-P1-003 | P1 | Soft-delete columns remain dead schema; DELETE endpoints hard-delete |
| DR-P1-001 | P1 | No backup or restore path exists for uploaded files in Supabase Storage |
| DR-P1-002 | P1 | Restore-test backup location contract (`S3_BACKUP_BUCKET`) is undocumented and can silently mismatch the backup script |
| DR-P1-003 | P1 | Database backups are unencrypted and stored in a single location with no offsite copy |
| DR-P1-004 | P1 | The restore test has no failure alert |
| DR-P1-005 | P1 | No automated migration reverse/rollback and no bad-migration drill |
| DR-P1-006 | P1 | RPO/RTO targets are documented but unvalidated, and the Postgres RPO conflates PITR with the daily dump |
| FILE-P1-001 | P1 | Public file-request upload is permission-gated and unreachable for anonymous uploaders |
| FILE-P1-002 | P1 | File-request uploads have no tenant-scoped path and no download path; orphan cleanup will delete them |
| FILE-P1-003 | P1 | Document version history objects are deleted at replace and by orphan cleanup |
| FINAL-P1-001 | P1 | P0 data-loss path and unverified "fixed" claim block a clean release |
| INFRA-P1-001 | P1 | SSH is open to the internet on both droplets (admin_ip_ranges default 0.0.0.0/0 and CI never overrides it) |
| INFRA-P1-002 | P1 | Terraform state-locking fix is incompatible with the pinned Terraform version (use_lockfile requires >= 1.10, workflows pin 1.9) |
| IR-P1-001 | P1 | Rollback documentation contradicts itself on SHA-targeted rollback |
| IR-P1-002 | P1 | Bad-migration recovery is manual-only with no automated reverse or staging proof |
| IR-P1-003 | P1 | Worker health failure during deploy is non-fatal |
| IR-P1-004 | P1 | Backups are not verified deeply enough to prove the documented RPO/RTO |
| IR-P1-005 | P1 | Backup bucket configuration is inconsistent between the script, the backup workflow, and the restore test |
| IR-P1-006 | P1 | No runtime detection or alerting for tenant-isolation (RLS) regressions |
| MT-P1-001 | P1 | Audit log list and export are not org-scoped by default |
| MT-P1-002 | P1 | Platform dashboards expose all-tenant aggregates to any single-org admin |
| MT-P1-003 | P1 | Public file-request upload authorizes with a permission unioned across all orgs |
| NOTIF-P1-001 | P1 | Notification preferences are stored and displayed but never enforced on any send path |
| NOTIF-P1-002 | P1 | API-originated notifications bypass the dedup unique index |
| NOTIF-P1-003 | P1 | No delivery observability: email/notification failures are silent and unalerted |
| REL-P1-001 | P1 | No version identity: no tags, no product version, no commit binding in generated artifacts |
| REL-P1-002 | P1 | Documented production deploy path is stated as non-functional and the approval gate claim is false |
| SBOM-P1-001 | P1 | No license allow/deny policy in dependency review or any CI gate |
| SBOM-P1-002 | P1 | SBOM carries no license data and no dependency graph, limiting triage and license review |
| SC-P1-001 | P1 | Critical/high advisories persist in the dev dependency tree; `next` override is mis-scoped |
| SEARCH-P1-001 | P1 | `sanitizeSearchTerm` does not strip PostgREST `.` operator separators |
| SEARCH-P1-002 | P1 | Admin global search exposes profile PII and never tenant-scopes the organizations query |
| SEC-P1-001 | P1 | PII field encryption silently degrades to reversible plaintext |
| SECRET-P1-001 | P1 | M365 webhook secret is dead config while the real M365 auth value is undocumented and undeployed |
| SECRET-P1-002 | P1 | Deploy pipeline does not write several secret-class env vars the API schema and compose reference |
| WH-P1-001 | P1 | Outbound webhook idempotency is non-atomic in the API and absent in the worker dispatcher |
| WH-P1-002 | P1 | M365 webhook auth depends on `M365_CLIENT_STATE` which the deploy pipeline does not write, while `M365_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is dead config |

## Verification required to change the verdict

Re-run the owning domains at the remediated commit and capture artifacts; confirm zero P0/P1 remains. This run records a delta only.
